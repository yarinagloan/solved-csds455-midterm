<strong>Problem 1:</strong>

Let <em>G </em>be a simple, undirected graph with an odd number of vertices. Let <em>X </em>be a non-empty set of all vertices with degree <em>n</em>(<em>G</em>)−1. Prove that if each component of <em>G</em>−<em>X </em>is a complete graph and if the number of odd components of <em>G </em>− <em>X </em>is less than or equal to |<em>X</em>|, then if we remove any vertex <em>v </em>of <em>G</em>, <em>G </em>− <em>v </em>will have a 1-factor.

<strong>Problem 2:</strong>

Let <em>G </em>be an undirected, simple graph with edge lengths that are positive real numbers. We would like a spanning tree of <em>G </em>that minimizes the maximum distance between any two leaves of the tree. Prove that we can find such a spanning tree with an algorithm whose running time is a polynomial in terms of the number of vertices and edges of <em>G</em>.

<strong>Problem 3:</strong>

Let <em>G </em>be a connected, undirected graph. We will call a graph <em>k-resilient </em>if we can delete any <em>k </em>vertices of <em>G </em>and for any pair of vertices that remain, there exists a simple cycle containing that pair that also avoids any deleted vertex. What is the minimum connectivity (either vertex or edge) needed for <em>G </em>to be <em>k</em>-resilient? Prove your answer correct.

<strong>Problem 4:</strong>

Let <em>G </em>be a bipartite graph with partition sets <em>X </em>and <em>Y </em>. Suppose that for all <em>A </em>⊆ <em>X </em>we have |<em>N</em>(<em>A</em>)| ≥ |<em>A</em>|. Prove that every edge of <em>G </em>is part of some matching of size |<em>X</em>|.

<strong>Problem 5:</strong>

Let <em>G </em>be a plane graph. Prove that if <em>G </em>is isomorphic to its dual <em>G</em><sup>∗ </sup>then <em>G </em>has 2<em>n </em>− 2 edges. Give an example of one such graph.
